## -Introduction:
Our OCTA image splicing dataset contains two main stages, where the first stage is the image alignment stage, which consists of a reference image, a target image, and a label; and the second stage is the image fusion stage, which contains five sub-datasets, consisting of center, input1, input2, input3, and input4. The following shows the data composition of each stage.
